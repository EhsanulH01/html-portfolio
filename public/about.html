<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ehsanul Haque, I’m 20 years old, and I was born in Bangladesh. I moved to New York City when I was young,
   and growing up here has definitely shaped who I am today. The city’s energy, diversity, and constant motion have influenced
    the way I think and approach life. I’ve always been curious about how things work, especially when it comes to technology,
     and that curiosity eventually led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m a college student studying Computer Science and trying to build a solid foundation in programming, algorithms,
   and software development. I enjoy learning how to solve problems through code and create things that can actually be used in the
    real world. Whether it's working with C++, exploring cybersecurity, or building small projects, I’m always looking for ways to
     grow my skills and understand the deeper concepts behind what I’m learning. I take my studies seriously because I know the effort
      I put in now will shape the opportunities I get later.</p>

<p>Living in NYC has its challenges, but it’s also full of inspiration. Being surrounded by people who are driven and always pushing
   forward motivates me to keep improving. At the same time, I stay grounded in my roots and values, carrying the perspective I gained
    from my background in Bangladesh. My goal is to combine that perspective with everything I’m learning to make a meaningful impact
     in tech and build a future I can be proud of.</p>
